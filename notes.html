            <h2>Swift Learning</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming revolves around inputs and outputs, used daily in various contexts.</li>
                <li>Data is crucial in programming:
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is a collection of different or the same values stored in a place.</li>
                        <li>With inputs of data, we can produce outputs of data.</li>
                        <li>Outputs are results or expressions derived from data inputs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There are many programming languages, with Swift being one of the most important.</li>
                <li>Naming objects minimizes confusion, which is known as abstraction or identifiers:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identifying objects helps clarify their purpose, making debugging easier later on.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Camel case is the naming system used in Swift:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first word remains lowercase.</li>
                        <li>The second word is capitalized, with no spaces between words.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In programming, the value of a text is called a string, made up of characters:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The order of the characters in a string is important.</li>
                        <li>Variables are used to store changing objects:</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Variables must be declared first, indicating they are subject to change.</li>
                <li>Constants refer to values that are not meant to change.</li>
                <li>Values, constants, variables, and data can be used to create simulations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Simulations recreate real-life scenarios.</li>
                        <li>By modeling with existing values and data, programmers can simulate variables and gather more data from these simulations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Big Idea 1</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaboration enhances thinking with more people, incorporating diverse perspectives and races without bias.</li>
                <li>Computing innovations can be both online or physical:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Why do they exist?</li>
                        <li>What problems do they solve?</li>
                        <li>What new capabilities do they provide that were previously unavailable?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Types of inputs include tactile, audio, visual, and text, and many devices accept different types of inputs.</li>
                <li>Outputs are triggered by inputs or code segments, functioning similarly to inputs but as results.</li>
                <li>A program is a collection of statements, containing code segments:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The working style of programs can differ.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Programs are developed by investigators who identify:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Constraints</li>
                        <li>User concerns and interests</li>
                        <li>Program requirements</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The development process involves:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brainstorming</li>
                        <li>Storyboarding</li>
                        <li>Planning</li>
                        <li>Laying out the plan</li>
                        <li>Organizing and developing</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A team of developers collaborates on programs, with each person having a specific role, and everyone deserving credit.</li>
                <li>Code segments used in development must be properly documented:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Documentation occurs at the beginning for listing specifications, during the project for tracking progress, and after the project to explain the overall process.</li>
                        <li>Some programming languages offer commenting, a form of documentation that doesn’t affect the code but helps future understanding.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Errors in programming are classified into 4 types:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Logic error: A mistake in the program or algorithm that causes the program to run incorrectly.</li>
                        <li>Syntax error: Similar to grammar errors, occur when the language rules aren’t followed.</li>
                        <li>Run-time error: Happens during the execution of the program, defined by each programming language.</li>
                        <li>Overflow error: Occurs when a computer tries to handle a number outside its defined range.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Syntax errors are typically easy to identify, as the language highlights the problematic line.</li>
                <li>Logic errors are the hardest to find and often require test cases:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Border cases (the limits of the code) are also important to test.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Hand tracing helps with loops by writing out variable values to determine the correctness of outcomes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hand tracing is used for small code segments, while larger segments may need debugging programs.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Visualizations or debuggers may be used if programs don’t work as expected.</li>
                <li>During the development process, testing involves:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using defined inputs to verify that an algorithm or program produces expected outcomes.</li>
                        <li>Programs are tested with inputs at or beyond the extremes of input data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Testing process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Programmers test right after developing the program.</li>
                        <li>Once inputs and outputs are determined, they test, edit, and retest the program continuously.</li>
                        <li>After programmer testing, users test the program to refine it further.</li>
                        <li>Once refined, the program is finally released.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Big Idea 2</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The binary system is made up of 2 digits: 0 and 1.
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 means "on" and 0 means "off."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A bit is short for "binary digit."
                    <ul>
                        <li>A byte means 8 bits.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There are billions of transistors in a computer, reflecting electrical signals representing 0 or 1.</li>
                <li>All information stored in devices is made up of 0 and 1 sequences, which are instructions.</li>
                <li>Abstraction reduces complexity and allows us to focus on the main idea or problem.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The use of digital data to approximate real-world analog data is an example of abstraction.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Sampling measures the value of the analog signal at regular intervals.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sampling helps determine how many bits are needed to store analog data in digital form.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Integers are represented in a fixed number of bits.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Some programming languages store up to 32 bits, which is 4 bytes.</li>
                        <li>4 bytes can represent over 4 billion values.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>An overflow error occurs when a program encounters a number larger than its storage space.</li>
                <li>Some programming languages have issues with real numbers, like round-up errors with numbers such as pi.</li>
                <li>The more bits available, the more integers can be represented.</li>
                <li>Constructing a binary number involves figuring out which powers of 2 add up to the number.</li>
                <li>Data compression reduces the number of bits needed to represent data, saving time and space.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Repeated characters are removed and replaced with a symbol or single character.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Lossless compression:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data.</li>
                        <li>Used for executables, spreadsheets, and text files.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Lossy compression:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Significantly reduces the number of bits but reconstructs only an approximation of the original data.</li>
                        <li>Used for graphics, audio, and images.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>When collecting data, consider the source and tools used to analyze it.</li>
                <li>While processing data, consider factors such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Size of the data: How much information can be gathered?</li>
                        <li>Can a single computer handle the tasks?</li>
                        <li>Is there a need for multiple processors to handle different parts of the task?</li>
                        <li>Do we need to check the scalability of the system?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Potential bias can occur when collecting data.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Know who collected the data and whether they have an agenda.</li>
                        <li>Be aware of how the data was collected.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Cleaning data involves dealing with incomplete, corrupt, duplicate, or inaccurate records:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Modify, replace, or delete dirty data.</li>
                        <li>Ensure there's a reason for the modification and keep a record of changes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Metadata means "data about data":
                    <ul>
                        <li>It includes information such as the author, date, and size of the data.</li>
                        <li>Metadata is used to track, organize, process, and identify data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Metadata is used in many fields and suggests data patterns or structure.</li>
